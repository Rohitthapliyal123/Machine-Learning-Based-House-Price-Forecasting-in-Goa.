# Machine-Learning-Based-House-Price-Forecasting-in-Goa.

This project develops a machine learning model designed to accurately predict real estate prices in Goa. By analyzing key features, the model aims to foster a deeper understanding of the Goa housing market, empowering better, data-driven decisions.

## Project Objective-

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict real estate prices in Goa. The model utilizes key features such as location (longitude, latitude, ocean_proximity), housing characteristics (age, total rooms, total bedrooms), and economic indicators (population, households, median income) to estimate the median house value. The goal is to provide a data-driven framework for anticipating the Goa housing market, aiding in informed decision-making for buyers, sellers, and investors.

## Technology Used -
